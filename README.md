# Learning Godot by rewriting Zelia

Last year I collaborated with my son on creating a game from scratch. 

We soon discovered that a game needs a lot of content and ended up one year later with a _lot_ of level editor and very little game.

You can download the windows installer on [itch.io](https://renevanderark.itch.io/zelia-mystery-mage-and-adventure-maker)

I will not be open sourcing the original game, but I _will_ be showing a lot of typescript and python snippets in these tutorials along the way.

## Let's dive right in.

I will be documenting my work in numbered days, some days we'll get a lot done. On others, well you know how that goes.
