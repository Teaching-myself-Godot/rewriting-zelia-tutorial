# Learning Godot by rewriting Zelia

Last year I collaborated with my son on creating a game from scratch. 

We soon discovered that a game needs a lot of content and ended up one year later with a _lot_ of level editor and very little game.

You can download the windows installer on [itch.io](https://renevanderark.itch.io/zelia-mystery-mage-and-adventure-maker)

## The code
I will not be open sourcing the original game, but I _will_ probably be showing a lot of typescript and python snippets from it in these tutorials along the way.

The code for this tutorial will be living in it's [sister repo on github](https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/godot-zelia).

## Fair warning
Although I am a software developer with about 20 years of experience, over half of that professionally, **I'm totally new to godot**. 

The good news is that we will both be having the [beginner's mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) and you can contribute if you like! 

We'll discover how that goes together as well.

## Let's dive right in.

I will be documenting my work in numbered days, some days we'll get a lot done. On others, well you know how that goes.
