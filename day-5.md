# Slimes, Breaking tiles, Fallings Tiles, Scenery Tiles and Shaders

So for you it is day five, for me it's now day 14. :D

## Why so slow?

The reason is the research I did into Godot stuff you don't get out of the box:

- recipes that are stably invented for version 3, but need some translation to 4.1
- shading language concepts (last time I tried _that_ was back when GLSL was just released)
- which 'physics'-body to use for what and how (Rigid -> Static -> Rigid -> Character -> Area -> Static -> Rigid -> ooooh... I used the wrong method to apply the motion!)
- where's that polygon?! TileMap -> get_used_cells() -> TileData -> no ... TileMap -> get_used_cells() -> TileSetSource -> TileSet**Atlas**Source -> TileData -> get_collision_polygon_points() -> no?? ... yes! ... forgot to draw a polygon!

You're going to be spoiled with some 4.1 reÃ¯nvented recipes! (I hope)

## Any other excuses?

And the other reason is: my son wanted to write a 2.5D game last weekend: https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/untitled-shoot-em-up 


## What we'll do today

1. [Make a bouncing Slime monster](#make-a-bouncing-slime-monster)
2. [Add the tree-trun terrain](#add-the-tree-trunk-terrain)
2. [Make tiles Zelia can break](#make-tiles-zelia-can-break)
3. [Allow those breakable tiles to fall down](#allow-those-breakable-tiles-to-fall-down)
4. [Reuse tiles as background scenery](#reuse-tiles-as-background-scenery)
5. [Review my failed attempt to replace my TextureRenditions singleton with shaders](#review-my-failed-attempt-to-replace-my-texturerenditions-singleton-with-shaders)


# Make a bouncing Slime monster

Every game needs one

# Add the `tree-trunk` terrain

Because Zelia (in the original game) runs into tiles that are not just squares, our rewrite must have them as well:

1. Create a new Terrain in `World > Inspector > Terrain Sets > Terrains`: "Tree Trunk"
2. Add the `res://surface_maps/tree-trunk/1.png` to our existing `TileSet` - like we learned on [day 2](day-2.md#making-an-atlas-of-an-image).
3. Be sure to assign Terrain `1` this time, under the `Select` step
4. When you get to the step for `Physics` with the `F`-hotkey we're going to do something new, but first...
5. Don't forget to also create the 1 alternative tile (in case you want to handle all the drag-and-draw painting)

### Create polygons

...TODO screenshot and explicit description here! ...

### Solve Technical debt 3

TODO --> Unloosen tight coupling, separate `World` into `Game` and `Terrain`

# Make tiles Zelia can break

Still not as cool as in the original, but close enough!


# Allow those breakable tiles to fall down

Rigid -> Static -> Rigid -> Character -> Area -> Static -> Rigid -> ooooh...

Spoiler: it was [StaticBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_staticbody2d.html#class-staticbody2d) I wanted all along.

# Reuse tiles as background scenery

My first [shader](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/your_first_shader/your_first_2d_shader.html) was not that fancy at all.

# Review my failed attempt to replace my TextureRenditions singleton with shaders

My [second shader](https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/godot-zelia/blob/no-per-instance-shaders-for-canvas_items/dissipation_shader.gdshader) was pretty cool, but alas: all the fireballs scattered together.
