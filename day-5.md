# Slimes, Breaking tiles, Falling Tiles, Scenery Tiles and Shaders

So for you it is day five, for me it's now day 14. :D

## Why so slow?

The reason is the research I did into Godot stuff you don't get out of the box:

- recipes that are stably invented for version 3, but need some translation to 4.1
- shading language concepts (last time I tried _that_ was back when GLSL was just released)
- which 'physics'-body to use for what and how (Rigid -> Static -> Rigid -> Character -> Area -> Static -> Rigid -> ooooh... I used the wrong method to apply the motion!)
- where's that polygon?! TileMap -> get_used_cells() -> TileData -> no ... TileMap -> get_used_cells() -> TileSetSource -> TileSet**Atlas**Source -> TileData -> get_collision_polygon_points() -> no?? ... yes! ... forgot to draw a polygon!

You're going to be spoiled with some 4.1 reÃ¯nvented recipes! (I hope)

## Any other excuses?

And the other reason is: my son wanted to write a 2.5D game last weekend: [Untitled Shoot 'em Up](https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/untitled-shoot-em-up/tree/master)


## What we'll do today

1. [Make a bouncing Slime monster](#make-a-bouncing-slime-monster)
2. [Add the tree-trunk terrain](#add-the-tree-trunk-terrain)
3. [Make tiles Zelia can break](#make-tiles-zelia-can-break)
4. [Allow those breakable tiles to fall down](#allow-those-breakable-tiles-to-fall-down)
5. [Reuse tiles as background scenery](#reuse-tiles-as-background-scenery)
6. [Review my failed attempt to replace my TextureRenditions singleton with shaders](#review-my-failed-attempt-to-replace-my-texturerenditions-singleton-with-shaders)


# Make a bouncing Slime monster

Every game needs one.

## Setting up the slime scene

1. Download the zip: [assets/green-slime.zip](https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/rewriting-zelia-tutorial/raw/main/assets/green-slime.zip)
2. Create the resource dirs `res://monsters/slime/green`
3. Extract the .png files in that `res://monsters/slime/green` dir 
4. Create a new `CharacterBody2D`-scene
5. Rename it to `Slime`
6. And save it into `res://monsters/slime/slime.tscn`
7. Give slime a child node `AnimatedSprite2D`
8. Navigate to its `Inspector Sprite Frames > SpriteFrame > Animations`
9. Change `default` into `airborne`, add `slime/green/5.png` to it
10. Add `floor_bounce` and add `1.png` - `4.png` to that -> in that order
11. Set `floor_bounce` to `7 fps` for the nicest effect:

![slime](screenshots/slime.png)

### Add `2` collision shapes

Because our slime looks a little different depending on what state it's in, let's give it 2 collision shapes:

1. Add a child `CollisionShape2D`-node to `Scene > Slime` 
2. Name it: `AirborneCollisionShape`
3. Pick `CircleShape2D` under `Inspector > Shape`
4. Align it nicely around the `airborne` animation sprite:

![slime airborne coll circle](screenshots/airborne-collision-shape.png)

Next:
1. Add another child `CollisionShape2D`-node to `Scene > Slime` 
2. Name it: `FloorBounceCollisionShape`
3. Pick `CapsuleShape2D` under  `Inspector > Shape`
4. Align it around the first `floor_bounce` animation sprite:

![slime capsule](screenshots/slime-capsule.png)

## Setting up the `slime.gd` script

Add the slime to the main scene:

1. Open `res://world.tscn`
2. Drag at least one slime scene `res://monsters/slimes/slime.tscn` into the `World`-scene
3. Test the main scene `World` with `F5` and observe that the slime hangs there doing nothing:

![slime hanging there](screenshots/slime-hanging.png)

4. Open the `res://monsters/slimes/slime.tscn` scene
5. Attach a script to it, picking the default values in the dialog
6. You might notice a lot of suggested code for a `CharacterBody2D` - although it could be fun to try it out, it's not what we're looking for.
7. Remove all code and replace the `_physics_process` function body with `pass`:

```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D


func _physics_process(delta):
	pass
```

### Adding the `MovementState`s

We have 2 animations currently, so let's create 2 movement states to match:
```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

enum MovementState { AIRBORNE, FLOOR_BOUNCE }

var movement_state : int

func _ready():
    # assume it starts out hanging in the air
    movement_state = MovementState.AIRBORNE

    # start up the correct animated sprite sprite frames for that state
	$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "airborne"
	$AnimatedSprite2D.play()

```

We also know the slime must bounce around. We can use some familiar stuff for that:

```gdscript
# We want the level designer to be able to modify stuff like this.
@export var JUMP_VELOCITY = -400.0
var gravity = ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")
```

Now let's at the very least allow some `move_and_slide()` in the `_physics_process`, applying the gravity:
```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta):
	velocity.y += gravity * delta
    move_and_slide()
```
Now test again ith `F5` - the slime falls down and lands on the tiles.

### Picking the right collision shape

As we saw when we were setting up the scene, the slime has 2 `CollisionShapes2D`s attached of which only one should be active at a time, base on its `movement_state`.

Create a func `pick_collision_shape_for_movement_state`:
```gdscript
# enable the collision shape that matches the current movement state
func pick_collision_shape_for_movement_state():
	match (movement_state):
		MovementState.AIRBORNE:
			$AirborneCollisionShape.disabled = false
			$FloorBounceCollisionShape.disabled = true
		MovementState.FLOOR_BOUNCE:
			$AirborneCollisionShape.disabled = true
			$FloorBounceCollisionShape.disabled = false
```

And make sure to invoke it once the slime is instantiated:
```gdscript
func _ready():
	# assume it starts out hanging in the air
	movement_state = MovementState.AIRBORNE
	
	# enable the collision shape that matches the movement state
	pick_collision_shape_for_movement_state()
```

### Setting the right movement state in the `_physics_process`

When we programmed the player (hacked it together the 1st time) we had to do a lot of refactor work early on to make the `player.gd` code more understandable and maintainable.

The most important step we took was to separate out two stages in the `_physics_process` to determine what the player should do in this _iteration_ (this time around in the infinite loop):
1. `set_movement_state()`
2. `handle_movement_state()`

Even though it felt artificial to force such a hard separation in 2 functions, it made some code that is easier for a human (like us, I hope) to reason about.

Let's reapply it here, so first create the 2 new empty functions `set_movement_state` and `handle_movement_state` and invoke them from `_physics_process`, right after the gravity is applied:

```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta):
	# Apply gravity
	velocity.y += gravity * delta
	# Set, and handle movement state 
	set_movement_state()
	handle_movement_state()

	move_and_slide()
```

## Programming the full slime behaviour in steps

Now we will reason our way to a working, bouncing slime. Coding it in small steps:

1. [Make the slime bounce up and down](#make-the-slime-bounce-up-and-down)
2. [Make the slime bounce in the direction of the player](#make-the-slime-bounce-in-the-direction-of-the-player)
3. [Make the slime take damage from fireballs](#make-the-slime-take-damage-from-fireballs)
4. [Allow the slime to die from damage](#allow-the-slime-to-die-from-damage)
5. [Make the slime hurt the player by bouncing into the player](#make-the-slime-hurt-the-player-by-bouncing-into-the-player)

### Make the slime bounce up and down

Let's start out by making it land nicely. So we set the correct movement state and animated sprite when the slime is on the floor:
```gdscript
func set_movement_state():
	if is_on_floor():
		movement_state = MovementState.FLOOR_BOUNCE
		pick_collision_shape_for_movement_state()
		$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "floor_bounce"
```

Test using `F5`.

The next step is to make it bounce up again round about when the `"floor_bounce"` animation finishes. We'll need a one-shot timer for that and we need to start it at the right moment:

1. Go to `Scene > Slime` and add a child node `Timer`
2. Rename it to `FloorBounceTimer`
3. Make sure `One Shot` is check to `On` under `Inspector`
4. Set its `Wait Time` to `0.571s`

"Why `0.571s`," you say? Well, it's 7fps times 4 animation frames: 
`1 / 7 * 4`.

5. Go to `Node > Timer` and double-click `timeout()`
6. Keep the defaults and attach it to the `Slime`'s script
7. So this is the moment we want the slime to jump up again, let's write:

```gdscript
func start_jump():
	velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY

func _on_floor_bounce_timer_timeout():
	start_jump()
```

8. We also need to start the timer when we know the slime has landed:
```gdscript
func set_movement_state():
	if is_on_floor():
        # place this new code _before_ changing the movement_state!
        # so only start the timer at the moment of _landing_
		if movement_state == MovementState.AIRBORNE:
			$FloorBounceTimer.start()
		movement_state = MovementState.FLOOR_BOUNCE
		pick_collision_shape_for_movement_state()
		$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "floor_bounce"
```

Test with `F5`: it only flies up once and it looks off.

We're still missing something! We need to set the correct movement state, animation and collision shape for when `is_on_floor()` is `false`:

```gdscript
func set_movement_state():
	if is_on_floor():
        # ... leave the same ...
	else:
		movement_state = MovementState.AIRBORNE
		pick_collision_shape_for_movement_state()
		$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "airborne"
```

Test with `F5`: that looks a _lot_ better

[![bouncies!](screenshots/bounce-anim.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/rewriting-zelia-tutorial/main/screenshots/bounce-anim.mp4)

#### Refactor early.

The code is cluttering up already. Also, we have not made us of our somewhat artificial separation between `set_movement_state` and `handle_movement_state` yet. 

That separation was supposed to make the code easier to reason about, So now apply the following early '_incisions_' >:)

Move the code that is more about _handling_ the current `movement_state` to the function `handle_movement_state`:

```gdscript
func handle_movement_state():
	pick_collision_shape_for_movement_state()
	# pick the animation sprite for the current movement state
	match(movement_state):
		MovementState.FLOOR_BOUNCE:
			$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "floor_bounce"
		MovementState.AIRBORNE:
			$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "airborne"
```

Now you can remove a lot of code from `set_movement_state`, leaving only the stuff that is more about _setting_ a new `movement_state`:

```gdscript
func set_movement_state():
	if is_on_floor():
		if movement_state == MovementState.AIRBORNE:
			$FloorBounceTimer.start()
		movement_state = MovementState.FLOOR_BOUNCE
	else:
		movement_state = MovementState.AIRBORNE
```

We still have a `match`-block that needs a comment to explain what it does. Let's fix that by creating a function for it:
```gdscript
func pick_sprite_for_movement_state():
	match(movement_state):
		MovementState.FLOOR_BOUNCE:
			$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "floor_bounce"
		MovementState.AIRBORNE:
			$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "airborne"
```

Did you notice we applied the lesson we learned on day 3 about [refactoring big functions](day-3.md#extract-some-functions-for-less-messy-code)?

### Make the slime bounce in the direction of the player

### Make the slime take damage from fireballs

### Allow the slime to die from damage

### Make the slime hurt the player by bouncing into the player


# Add the `tree-trunk` terrain

Because Zelia (in the original game) runs into tiles that are not just squares, our rewrite must have them as well:

1. Create a new Terrain in `World > Inspector > Terrain Sets > Terrains`: "Tree Trunk"
2. Add the `res://surface_maps/tree-trunk/1.png` to our existing `TileSet` - like we learned on [day 2](day-2.md#making-an-atlas-of-an-image).
3. Be sure to assign Terrain `1` this time, under the `Select` step
4. When you get to the step for `Physics` with the `F`-hotkey we're going to do something new, but first...
5. Don't forget to also create the 1 alternative tile (in case you want to handle all the drag-and-draw painting)

### Create polygons

...TODO screenshot and explicit description here! ...

### Solve Technical debt 3

TODO --> Unloosen tight coupling, separate `World` into `Game` and `Terrain`

# Make tiles Zelia can break

Still not as cool as in the original, but close enough!


# Allow those breakable tiles to fall down

Rigid -> Static -> Rigid -> Character -> Area -> Static -> Rigid -> ooooh...

Spoiler: it was [StaticBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_staticbody2d.html#class-staticbody2d) I wanted all along.

# Reuse tiles as background scenery

My first [shader](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/your_first_shader/your_first_2d_shader.html) was not that fancy at all.

# Review my failed attempt to replace my TextureRenditions singleton with shaders

My [second shader](https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/godot-zelia/blob/no-per-instance-shaders-for-canvas_items/dissipation_shader.gdshader) was pretty cool, but alas: all the fireballs scattered together.
