# Day 3 - Importing more Tiles the lazy way

'Cus a lazy developer is a good developer.

Today we want to achieve these goals:

1. Test if tiles of different `Atlases` will stick to eachother when assigned to the same `Terrain`
2. If no, never mind, if yes then yay!
3. Detect an `Atlas`-import pattern by `diffing` the `world.tscn` file.
4. Try to auto-import all the `.png` files in `surface_maps` with our own script.

However, _will_ we achieve these goals?

Let's find out.
