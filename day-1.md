# Day 1 - Controlling the player

So before we start a day: please look at the prerequisites and make sure you are familiar with all the links referred to.

## Prerequisites

I started learning godot 4.1.1 yesterday.

What I did first is make the example 2D game there, after carefully reading up on the key concepts:

- [Key concepts](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/key_concepts_overview.html)
- [Step by Step](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html)
- [Your first 2D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)

## A new project
Let's start a new project.
